So you've run into some trouble..

Hope we can help!
If you select a "Room" button, eg. 'Room 1', it will display all booking info
for that month and that particular room. 
If no guests are booked then the table will be blank. 
If guests are booked, it will show their ID, full name, cell number and amount
still owed.
From this page you can select to book them excursions or delete a guest from
the booking system.
